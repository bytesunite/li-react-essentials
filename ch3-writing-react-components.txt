Working with lists
----------------------------------
The instructor starts out by replacing the <main> element with a custom component <Main> that returns a static list.
Then, it is updated to demonstrate using a dynamic list. A list is created and assigned to a variable in App.jsx and then this list is passed to the custom <Main> component.

Feel free to come up with your own food choices.
The instructor uses the following...

[App.jsx]
   ...
   const items = [
    "Macaroni and Cheese",
    "Salmon with Potatoes",
    "Tofu with Vegetables",
   ];

   function Header(){ ... }

   function Main({dishes}) {
    return (
      <ul style={{listStyle: 'none'}}>
      {dishes.map((dish) => <li key={dish}>{dish}</li>)}
      </ul>
    )
   }

   function App(){
    return (
      <>
        <Header />
        <Main dishes={items} />
      </>
    )
   }

In the example above I added a key, which is addressed by the instructor later.
I added CSS list styling to the <ul> instead of individual <li> items.

In the instructor's example a CSS style of "listStyleType" is added to each list item to change the list style to "none". EX: <li style={{listStyleType: 'none'}}>{dish}</li>
This does not seem right because 
1. you can easily set the style on the parent <ul> rather than each individual <li>.
2. The CSS property "listStyle" is shorthand for listStyleType.

If you view your code in the browser it will complain that each child in a list should have a unique "key". My example above addresses this because it used "key" but the instructor addresssing this in the next lesson.


Adding keys to list items
---------------------------------------
React uses a unique key to help keep track of each item via a "key" attribute with a unique value.
The JavaScript map() method is commonly used in React to generate content from lists.
The first argument is the value, the second is an (index).
Although the following example works using an index, React warns against this.


  const items = [
   "Macaroni and Cheese",
   "Salmon with Potatoes",
   "Tofu with Vegetables",
  ];
  
  function Main({dishes}){
    return (
      <ul>
        dishes.map((dish,i) => <li key={i}>{dish})
      </ul>
  ...
  function App(){
    ...
    <Main dishes={items}/>
  }


React warns against this because the "index" is not a unique identifier for a value. Instead an index accesses a position inside the collection.
When the collection changes the index still is based on position, not value.

Often lists of data come from a database and it automatically assigns a unique ID or uses something like a unique product ID.

In this example we can simulate this by generating a unique id for each item in our list, and use the id as the key in our component.

  const items = [
   "Macaroni and Cheese",
   "Salmon with Potatoes",
   "Tofu with Vegetables",
  ];

  const dishObjects = items.map((dish,index)=> ({
    id: index,
    title: dish
  }));
  
  function Main({dishes}){
    return (
      <ul>
        dishes.map((dish) => <li key={dish.id}>{dish.title})
      </ul>
  ...
  function App(){
    ...
    <Main dishes={dishObjects}/>
  }



The problem with index is that values are NOT identified uniquely by index.
An array uses an index to access by position only, not value. 
Once the array is modified (add, remove, or move), values within the array no longer have the same index number.

-- my note --
  You might think an array index would do the trick but this fails when inserting and deleting items from the list.

  The toSpliced() method on an array will create a new array. 
  toSpliced arguments are (starting index, items to remove or skip, value to insert)
  It is common not to modify objects directly in React but to create new ones.
  The reason for this is "reference types".
  
  // index     0      1      2
  let items = ["one", "two", "three"];
  
  // modify the array
  items = items.toSpliced(2,0,'two and a half');
  //
  // index 0      1      2                 3
  //      ["one", "two", "two and a half", "three"]

  Attempting to delete "three" by index (2),
  would delete "two and a half" accidentally.

  In comparison, a unique key helps track values.
  [ {key: 'i0a', value: "one"}, 
    {key: 'i0b', value: "two"} ]
  
  // add a new item - give it a unique id
    [ {key: 'i0a', value: "one"}, 
      {key: 'i0c', value: "two and a half"},
      {key: 'i0b', value: "two"} ]

  Attempting to delete "two" by index (1) after changes to an array, it would incorrectly delete "two and a half".
  However, with a unique key (i0b or whatever the unique key is) the correct item is removed.
  
  remove item with key 'i0b', removes "two".

  [ {key: i0a, value: "one"}, 
   {key: i0c, value: "two and a half"} ]

Displaying images with React
-------------------------------
https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/react-essential-training-5949338/tree/03_03b

The instructor adds a new folder "src/images" which has a image "chef.jpg".
We will learn how to display this image in a React App.

First, import the the chef image into to file where it will be used.

  import chef from './images/chef.jpg';

The instructor adds the image in the custom Main component.
A main tag wraps the image tag and unordered list tag.

The <img> component itself acts like the HTML equivalent so you can use the "src, alt, height" attributes.
NOTE: To specify a number such as width, wrap it in curly braces {200}
      If you want percent/rem use a string "1.5rem".
      You can also specify the "style" attribute:  style={{height: 200}}

   <main>
    <img src={chef} alt="A smiling restaurant chef" height:{200} />
    <ul>
    ...
    </ul>
   </main>


TIP: It is a good practice to include alt text to describe the image for screen readers.

If you want, you can use an external image by providing a url.

  <img src="http://example.com/chef.jpg" />


TIP: If you didn't know, you can also access your GitHub image using your GitHub name followed by .png
For example the instructor's profile image would be:

   https://github.com/eveporcello.png



Using Fragments
---------------------------------------
The instructor modifies the custom Main component to throw an error.
A sibling <div> tag to the <main> tag is created.
Running the app will throw an error complaining about adjacent JSX.

  // Fails!
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Welcome to our restaurant</h2>
    </div>
    <main>
     ...
    </main>
  )

This error was already brought up once in a previous lesson and the instructor fixed is by wrapping all siblings in a <div> tag.
However, React provides a Fragment component. In the past it was React.Fragment but the new way is a simple empty element <></>.

In the early days of react multiple sibling tags had to be wrapped in a useless <div> to meet the requirements that a component must return a single parent tag.
This pattern is similar to "div hell", where web developers overused <div> tags for practically everything, when a more appropriate semantic tag should have been used.
  
  // This works but is ugly - div hell
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>Welcome to our restaurant</h2>
      </div>
      <main>
       ...
      </main>
    </div>
  )

As React improved a Fragment tag was introduced, which let you produce results that would not insert useless <div> tags into your final webpage.
In the beginning you were limited to React.Fragment.
You could do this a couple ways, import React from 'react' and use <React.Fragment>
or you could do the following:

  import { Fragment } from 'react';

  function MyComponent(){
    return (
      <Fragment>
       ..
      </Fragment>
    );
  }


Then React introduced a clean and compact solution for a Fragment, an empty tag.

    return (
      <>
        <h2>Welcome to our restaurant</h2>
        <main>
         ...
        </main>
      <>
    );
  }


The <> is never rendered in the DOM. It provides cleaner HTML.

   <h2>
   <main>
    ...
   </main>


The instructor does NOT go into details of WHY React forces a single parent element returned from a React component. However, if you think about it, a React component is just a function and a JS function cannot return multiple values.
Here are a few examples:

  // Uncaught syntaxError: Unexpected string
  function fn(){
    return "one" "two";
                 ^^^^^^
  }


  // Uncaught syntaxError: Unexpected number
  function fn(){
    return 1 2;
             ^^
  }

  // Uncaught syntaxError: Unexpected token {
  function fn() {
    return {id:1, text:'one'} {id:2, text:'two'};
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  }

You might even think you could use comma-separated values but in this case the last value is returned. The comma (,) operator evaluates each of its operands (from left to right) and returns the value of the last operand.

In this example The value 1 is evaluted and thrown away, returning 2.

  // 2
  function fn(){
    return 1, 2
  }

In this example it increments x 

  let x = (1, 2); 

  console.log(x);  // 2


In this example it transforms the text to uppercase then returns it.
It can be hard to follow because typically developers would write this on separate lines and only return the updated value.

  let x = 'hello';

  function fn(){
    return x=x.toUpperCase(), x;
  }

  fn();  // HELLO
  console.log(x); // HELLO

  // more common to see
  function fn(){
    x = x.toUpperCase();
    return x;
  }
