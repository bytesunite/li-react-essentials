[Ch 4-5 Managing State with useReducer]
Suggestions:
1. The dispatch function is named "toggle" which is non-descriptive.
   Try using a name like "toggleStatus".
2. The lesson mentions a benefit of useReducer is 
   more complex state management
   Sadly, the instructor never demonstrates this.
3. The lesson mentions a benefit of useReducer is keeping logic
   out of the likes of onClick.
   However, you can still do this with useStatus by creating a handler
   function in the component, then specifying the function name in onClick.

    // handler function with useState
    function App() {
      const [status, setStatus] = useState(true);

      function statusToggleHandler() {
        setStatus(!status);
      }

      return (
        ...
        <button onClick={statusToggleHandler} ...
        ...
      )
    }
