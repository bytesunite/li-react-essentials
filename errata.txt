Chapter 4
---------------------------------------
[Ch 4-1 Destructuring arrays]
Suggestion:
1. Show how to use JavaScript's ... rest/spread operator
   Then show how to use this with props in 
   Ch 4-4 Handling state with neseted components.



[Ch 4-2 Understanding the useState hook]
Suggestions
1. Mention code convention of setter variable name starting with "set",
   followed by the name of the state variable.
2. Show how you can define a handler function and assign it to onClick.
   Later in the course it does this with useReducer but fails to do this
   earlier when discussing useState.



[Ch 4-5 Managing State with useReducer]
---------------------------------------
Suggestions:
1. The dispatch function is named "toggle" which is non-descriptive.
   Try using a name like "toggleStatus".
2. The lesson mentions a benefit of useReducer is 
   more complex state management
   Sadly, the instructor never demonstrates this.
3. The lesson mentions a benefit of useReducer is keeping logic
   out of the likes of onClick.
   However, you can still do this with useStatus by creating a handler
   function in the component, then specifying the function name in onClick.

    // handler function with useState
    function App() {
      const [status, setStatus] = useState(true);

      function statusToggleHandler() {
        setStatus(!status);
      }

      return (
        ...
        <button onClick={statusToggleHandler} ...
        ...
      )
    }



[ch4-6 Working with the useEffect hook]
-----------------------------------------
Suggestions:
* Explain WHEN useEffect() runs (during or after render). Provide examples. 
* Explain React's render cycle.
* Maybe mention that useEffect() is only used on the client, not the server.
* Point out how useEffect() can cause an endless loop when updating state within the body of the useEffect hook.



[ch4-quiz]
Error(s): answers contain topics that are not discussed in the course.

  * The first question talks about multiple useEffect() calls
    but this course fails to explain this can be done.
  * The second question talks about a "modal" 
    but this topic is never discussed in the course.
  * The fourth question mentions "Redux" 
    but this topic is never discussed.
  * The fifth question needs attention because useReducer()
    is not fully discussed to demonstrate complex state management
    The instructor only mentions useReducer() can be used for complex state.
