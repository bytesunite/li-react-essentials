Destructuring arrays
---------------------------------
The lesson starts out by creating a simple array of strings and accessing them by index.

    const animals = ['giraffe', 'zebra', 'bear'];

    console.log(animals[0]);  // giraffe

We can also take advantage of JavaScript destructuring by extracting values from the array into variables.

    const animals = ['giraffe', 'zebra', 'bear'];
    const [firstAnimal] = animals;
    console.log(firstAnimal); // giraffe

You can destructure the array by position from left to right.

    const animals = ['giraffe', 'zebra', 'bear'];
    const [firstAnimal, secondAnimal, thirdAnimal] = animals;
    console.log(firstAnimal); // giraffe
    console.log(secondAnimal); // zebra
    console.log(thirdAnimal); // bear

It is also possible to skip over elements with commas

    const animals = ['giraffe', 'zebra', 'bear'];
    const [, ,thirdAnimal] = animals;
    console.log(firstAnimal); // undefined
    console.log(secondAnimal); // undefined
    console.log(thirdAnimal); // bear


The instructor does not cover the rest/spread operator (...) which is used to group multiple items and then expand them. This can be helpful in React props. The instructor may or may not cover this later.
Both rest and spread use the same operator (...) but have separate purposes.
In the example "rest" can be any variable name but a common convention is to use this name.

    const animals = ['giraffe', 'zebra', 'bear'];

    // rest operator will group items together
    const [firstAnimal, ...rest] = animals;

    console.log(firstAnimal);  // giraffe
    console.log(rest); // ['zebra', 'bear']

    // spread operator will expand items from a collection
    const [secondAnimal, thirdAnimal] = [...rest];

    console.log(secondAnimal); // zebra
    console.log(thirdAnimal);  // bear
